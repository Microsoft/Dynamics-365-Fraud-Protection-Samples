# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection - API examples
## Make a purchase â€“ Approved purchase flow

After sending Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection a purchase event, you have the option to use the Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection decision to either continue with or stop the purchase workflow. To improve Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection models, inform Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection of the intermediate bank events and final purchase status for a purchase.

## Purchase Flow
A typical purchase event flow consists of:
1. Purchase event
1. Bank auth event
1. Bank charge event
1. Purchase status event

You typically send requests to your bank/payment gateway between some of these steps, so Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection identifies them as separate events. 

You are not required to send these events, or send them in any particular order, or within any specific time. The sample site does, in fact, follow this order. 

[!IMPORTANT] Purchase updates are not allowed. After you send a purchase ID, you cannot send the same purchase ID again; purchase events cannot be updated like other Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection events. If you send the same purchase ID again, an error response is returned. You can update the bank auth, bank charge, and purchase status events as many times as needed, though.

## Required data
- Purchase ID
- Purchase status
- Purchase status date
- User ID
- Bank auth ID
- Bank charge ID
- Merchant local date

## Optional data
- Bank auth data (status, response code, etc.)
- Bank charge data (status, response code, etc.)
- Purchase status reason

## Purchase event
Examples:
- [Make a Purchase - Existing User](./Make&#32;a&#32;purchase&#32;-&#32;Existing&#32;user.md)
- [Make a Purchase - Guest User](./Make&#32;a&#32;purchase&#32;-&#32;Guest&#32;user.md)

## Bank auth event
This example request sends a bank auth event to Fraud Protection telling it that the bank authorization was successful.

## Bank charge event
This example request sends a bank charge event to Fraud Protection telling it that the bank charge was successful.

    "MID": "<merchant ID sent to bank>",
    "Purchase": { "PurchaseId": "<purchase ID>" }
  }
}
```

## Purchase status event
This example request sends a purchase status event to Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection identifying that the purchase was successful from your perspective. The purchase status may differ from bank event statuses, and determined by you.
```http

Host: api.dfp.microsoft.com
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
